Description : 

My project is called as "mathfun" i.e maths function, which contains maximum self implemented math.h functions and some new functions.
I have implemented 18 function of math.h library. They are enlisted below
1) square
2) sqrt
3) cube
4) cbrtx           
5) fmod
6) hypot
7) Pow
8) fmax
9) fmin
10) fact
11) abs	
12) ceilx
13) floorx
14) dec_bin
15) decimal_octal
16) octal_decimal
17) binary_octal
18) octal_binary	

I have created my own test cases. In my test cases, I mentioned input and the expected output. In my main file, this input and expected output is evaluated and if the result is match with the expected output then the test case will pass otherwise fail.
For completing my project, I have learn many of the new concepts of the maths and taken reference from websites like tutorialspoint for more detailing of the project.
